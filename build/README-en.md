# Quick Start

## Prepare the compilation environment
1. Install a virtual machine, or use a local ubuntu system, recommend `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`
2. Install the serial port tool: `MobaXterm`, `Xshell` or other tools.
3. Install the compile dependencies.
```
sudo apt install pkg-config build-essential ninja-build automake autoconf libtool wget curl git gcc libssl-dev bc slib squashfs-tools android-sdk-libsparse-utils android-sdk-ext4-utils jq cmake python3-distutils tclsh scons parallel ssh-client tree python3-dev python3-pip device-tree-compiler libssl-dev ssh cpio squashfs-tools fakeroot libncurses5 flex bison dosfstools mtools
```
- Note: The minimum version of `cmake` requires `3.16.5`, if you are using `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, the apt will install `cmake` version `3.16.3`, which is lower than the minimal requirement, so you have to install the lastest version manually:
```
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.27.6/cmake-3.27.6-linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x cmake-3.27.6-linux-x86_64.sh
sudo sh cmake-3.27.6-linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license --prefix=/usr/local/
```
- You can found it under `/usr/bin/local`, to check it's version, using `cmake --version`:
```
cmake version 3.27.6
```

## Get SDK source code
- This repository is using scripts for sub-repositories, to get the SDK, using commands below:
```
git clone https://github.com/sophgo/sophpi.git -b sg200x-evb
cd sophpi
./scripts/repo_clone.sh --gitclone scripts/subtree.xml
```
- If the way above does not working for you, or you are under the `build` repository, please clone these repos one by one, you could check the [#FAQ](#faq) section for more information.

## Prepare cross-compilation tools
If you did not encountered any issues in the previous step, you can just skip this step.
- Get the cross-compilation toolchain
```
wget https://sophon-file.sophon.cn/sophon-prod-s3/drive/23/03/07/16/host-tools.tar.gz
```
- Unpack the toolchain and link to the SDK directory
```
tar xvf host-tools.tar.gz
cd sophpi/
ln -s ../host-tools ./
```

## Compile
- Take `sg2000_duo_sd` as an example
```
cd sophpi/
```
- Enable the `envsetup_soc.sh` script.
```
source build/envsetup_soc.sh
```
- The script will print it's uasge.
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Usage:
  (1) menuconfig - Use menu to configure your board.
      ex: $ menuconfig

  (2) defconfig $CHIP_ARCH - List EVB boards($BOARD) by CHIP_ARCH.
      ** sg200x ** -> ['sg2000', 'sg2002']
      ** cv181x ** -> ['cv1812cp', 'cv1812h', 'cv1813h']
      ** cv180x ** -> ['cv1800b']
      ex: $ defconfig cv181x

  (3) defconfig $BOARD - Choose EVB board settings.
      ex: $ defconfig cv1813h_wevb_0007a_spinor
      ex: $ defconfig cv1812cp_wevb_0006a_spinor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
- Following the uasge, Enter `defconfig sg200x` for supported boards.
```
* sg200x * the avaliable cvitek EVB boards
  sg2000 - sg2000_duo_sd [C906B + EMMC 8192MB + DDR 512MB]
  sg2002 - sg2002_duo_sd [C906B + EMMC 8192MB + DDR 256MB]
```
- According to your borads version, enter `clean_all && build_all` to start compiling.
```
defconfig sg2000_duo_sd
clean_all && build_all
pack_burn_image
```
- You could find final images under `install` directory.

## SD card burning
### Using Image
> Note: Writing image to the SD card will erase all existing data on the card. Don't forget to back up important data before burning!
- For Windows Users, you can use tools like `balenaEtcher`, `Rufus`, or `Win32 Disk Imager`.
- For Linux Users, you can use `dd` command like this:
```
sudo dd if=sophpi-duo-XXX.img of=/dev/sdX
```
### Using upgrade zip
- Connect the serial cable of the EVB board.
- Format the SD card into FAT32 format.
- Unzip the compressed file `upgrade.zip` in the `install` directory and put it into the root directory of the SD card. Contents of the compressed file may be different depend on different borads, for example:
```
soc_cv1812h_wevb_0007a_emmc
.
├── boot.emmc
├── cfg.emmc
├── fip.bin
├── META/
├── partition_emmc.xml
├── rootfs.emmc
├── system.emmc
└── utils/

soc_cv1800b_sophpi_duo_sd
.
├── boot.sd
├── META/
├── partition_sd.xml
├── rootfs.sd
└── utils/
```
- Insert the SD card into the SD card slot.
- Power on the platform again, and it will automatically start the burning process when it is turned on.
- After burning successfully finished, unplug the SD card, power on the board again, and enter the system.
