/**
* @brief
@verbatim

This function stops operation of the current frame and initializes VPU hardware
by sending reset signals. It can be used when VPU is having a longer delay or
seems hang-up. After VPU has completed initialization, the context is rolled
back to the state before calling the previous VPU_DecStartOneFrame() or
VPU_EncStartOneFrame(). HOST can resume decoding from the next picture, instead
of decoding from the sequence header. It works only for the current instance, so
this function does not affect other instance\'s running in multi-instance
operation.

This is some applicable scenario of using `VPU_SWReset()` when a series of
hang-up happens. For example, when VPU is hung up with frame 1, HOST application
calls `VPU_SWReset()` to initialize VPU and then calls `VPU_DecStartOneFrame()`
for frame 2 with specifying the start address, read pointer. If there is still
problem with frame 2, we recommend calling `VPU_SWReset()` and `seq_init()` or
calling `VPU_SWReset()` and enabling iframe search.

SET_ADDR_REP_USERDATA command. `parameter` is interpreted as a pointer to the
value of size. This command returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

According to codec standards, user data type means as below.

@* H.264/AVC
@** 4 : user_data_registered_itu_t_t35
@** 5 : user_data_unregistered

More details are in Annex D of H.264 specifications.

@* VC1
@** 31 : Sequence Level user data
@** 30 : Entry-point Level user data
@** 29 : Frame Level user data
@** 28 : Field Level user data
@** 27 : Slice Level user data

@* MPEG2

@* MPEG4
@** 0 : VOS user data
@** 1 : VIS user data
@** 2 : VOL user data
@** 3 : GOV user data

NOTE: This command is available soon.

The user data size 0 - 15 is used to make offset from userDataBuf Base + 8x17.
It specifies byte size of user data 0 to 15 excluding 0 padding byte,
which exists between user data. So HOST reads 1 user data from
userDataBuf Base + 8x17 + 0 User Data Size + 0 Padding.
Size of 0 padding is (8 - (User Data Size % 8))%8.

====== SET_USERDATA_REPORT_MODE
TBD

This command sets the secondary channel of AXI for saving memory bandwidth to
dedicated memory. The argument `parameter` is interpreted as a pointer to
SecAxiUse which represents an enable flag and physical address which is related
with the secondary channel for BIT processor, IP/AC-DC predictor, de-blocking
filter, overlap filter respectively.

This command has one of the following return codes::

* RETCODE_SUCCESS:
Operation was done successfully, which means given value for setting secondary
AXI is valid.
* RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM:
The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid, which means given value
is invalid.

====== SET_DRAM_CONFIG
TBD

====== GET_DRAM_CONFIG
TBD

====== ENABLE_REP_BUFSTAT
This command enables frame buffer status report. This command ignores
`parameter` and returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

If this option is enabled, frame buffer status is reported.
Each frame buffers can be used for display, reference or not used. Decoder
reports the status of each frame buffer by using 4 bits [3:0]

@* [3] Not used
@* [2] USE_DIS
@* [1] USE_REF
@* [0] Not used

For example, if the value of frame buffer status is 6, then the frame buffer is
used for reference and display. If 4, the frame buffer is used for display and
is not used for reference.

In H.264/AVC, bit field definition is as bellows:

@* [3] Not used
@* [2] USE_DIS
@* [1] USE_OUT
@* [0] USE_REF

If USE_OUT is 1, it means that the Frame is in DPB buffer.

====== DISABLE_REP_BUFSTAT
This command disables frame buffer status report. This command ignores
`parameter` and returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

====== ENABLE_REP_MBPARAM
This command enables MB Parameter report. This command ignores `parameter` and
returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

If this option is enabled, error flag, Slice Boundary and QP are reported using
8 bits.

@* [7] : Error Map. If error is detected in macroblock decoding, this bit field
is set to 1.
@* [6] : Slice Boundary. Whenever new slice header is decoded, this bit field is
toggled.
@* [5:0] : An macroblock QP value

====== DISABLE_REP_MBPARAM
This command disables MB Parameter report. This command ignores `parameter` and
returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

====== ENABLE_REP_MV
This command enables MV report. This command ignores `parameter` and returns
RETCODE_SUCCESS.

If this option is enabled, decoder reports 1 motion vector for P picture and 2
motion vectors for B picture.

====== DISABLE_REP_MV
This command disables MV report. This command ignores `parameter` and returns
RETCODE_SUCCESS.

====== SET_ADDR_REP_PICPARAM
This command sets the address of picture parameter base. `parameter` is
interpreted as a pointer to a address.

This command has one of the following return codes.::

* RETCODE_SUCCESS:
Operation was done successfully, which means given value of address is valid and
setting is done successfully.
* RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM:
The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid, which means given value
of address is invalid. The value of address must be greater than 0 and a
multiple of 8.

To report frame buffer status, MB parameter and Motion vector, VPU reads the
base addresses of external memory, which are specified by PicParaBaseAddr.

[[dec_picparam_address_struct]]
.Decoder Picture parameter base address structure

image::../figure/dec_picparam_address_struct.svg["Decoder Picture parameter base
address structure", width=300] endif::pdf[] ifdef::html[]
image::../figure/dec_picparam_address_struct.png[Decoder Picture parameter base
address structure] endif::html[]

When `picUserDataEnable`, `mvReportEnable`, `mbParamEnable` or `frmBufStaEnable`
in CMD_DEC_PIC_OPTION register are enabled, HOST application should specify
buffer addresses in
<<dec_picparam_address_struct>>.
VPU reports each data and fills info, Data Size and MV num fields to
 these buffer addresses of external memory. For VPU to report data
properly, HOST application needs to specify these 3 buffer addresses preserving
8 byte alignment and buffer sizes need to be multiples of 256.

====== SET_ADDR_REP_BUF_STATE

This command sets the buffer address of frame buffer status. The `parameter` is
interpreted as a pointer to the address.

This command has one of the following return codes::

* RETCODE_SUCCESS: Operation was done successfully, which means given value of
address is valid and setting is done successfully.
* RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM: The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid,
which means given value of address is invalid. The value of address must be
greater than 0 and a multiple of 8.

====== SET_ADDR_REP_MBMV_DATA

This command sets the buffer address of motion vector information reporting
array. The `parameter` is interpreted as a pointer to the address.

This command has one of the following return codes.::

* RETCODE_SUCCESS: Operation was done successfully, which means given value of
address is valid and setting is done successfully.
* RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM: The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid,
which means given value of address is invalid. The value of address must be
greater than 0 and a multiple of 8.

The motion vector information reporting array consists of below fields for each
macroblock. The array element has 32 bit data per a macroblock.

.Description of SET_ADDR_REP_MBMV_DATA
[separator="|", frame="all", grid="all"]

value for X axis 13:00      | Mv Y            | Signed motion vector value for Y
axis
________________________________________________________________________________

====== SET_CACHE_CONFIG

This command sets the configuration of cache. The `parameter` is interpreted as
a pointer to MaverickCacheConfig.

This command has one of the following return codes.::

* RETCODE_SUCCESS:
Operation was done successfully, which means given value is valid and setting is
done successfully.
* RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM:
The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid. The value of address
must be not zero.

====== GET_TILEDMAP_CONFIG
This command gets tiled map configuration according to `TiledMapConfig`
structure.

This command has one of the following return codes.::

* RETCODE_SUCCESS:
Operation was done successfully, which means given value is valid and setting is
done successfully.
* RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM:
The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid, which means it has a
null pointer, or given values for some member variables are improper values.

====== SET_LOW_DELAY_CONFIG
This command sets the low delay decoding options which enable low delay decoding
and indicate the number of MB row. The argument `parameter` is interpreted as a
pointer to LowDelayInfo which represents an enable flag and the number of MB
row. If low delay decoding is enabled, VPU sends an interrupt and
indexFrameDisplay to HOST when the number of MB row decoding is done. If the
interrupt is issued, HOST should clear the interrupt and read indexFrameDisplay
from the RET_DEC_PIC_FRAME_IDX register in order to display.

====== DEC_GET_DISPLAY_OUTPUT_INFO
HOST can get decoder output information according to display index in
DecOutputInfo structure. HOST can set display index using member variable
`indexFrameDisplay`. This command returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

* Example code
.........................................................................
DecOutputInfo decOutputInfo;
decOutputInfo. indexFrameDisplay = disp_index;
VPU_DecGiveCommand(handle, DEC_GET_DISPLAY_OUTPUT_INFO, & decOutputInfo);
.........................................................................

====== SET_DECODE_FLUSH
This command is used to change bitstream buffer mode from Interrupt mode to
Picture End mode. When HOST receives an interrupt about bistream buffer empty in
Interrupt Mode, but there is no more bitstream for the current frame in
bitstream buffer, this command completes decoding only with remaining bitstream.

This command returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

====== DEC_SET_FRAME_DELAY
HOST can set the number of frame to be delayed before display (H.264/AVC only)
by using this command. This command is useful when display frame buffer delay is
supposed to happen for buffering decoded picture reorder and HOST is sure of
that. Unless this command is executed, VPU has display frame buffer delay as
frameBufDelay value of DecInitialInfo structure.

====== DEC_FREE_FRAME_BUFFER
HOST can free all the frame buffers allocated by VPUAPI.
This command is useful when VPU detects sequence change.
For example, if HOST knows resolution change while decoding through
`sequenceChanged` variable of DecOutputInfo structure, HOST should change the
size of frame buffer accordingly. This command is used to release the frame
buffers allocated for the previous sequence. Then VPU_DecGetInitialInfo() and
VPU_DecIsseuSeqInit() are called before frame buffer allocation for a new
sequence.

====== DEC_SET_DISPLAY_FLAG
Applications can set a display flag for each frame buffer by calling this
function after creating decoder instance. If a certain display flag of frame
buffer is set, the frame buffer cannot be used in the decoding process.
Applications can control displaying a buffer with this command to prevent VPU
from using buffer in every decoding process.

This command is the opposite of what VPU_DecClrDispFlag() does.
All of buffer flags are initialized with 0x00000000 which means being able to
decode. Unless it is called, VPU starts decoding with available frame buffer
that has been cleared in round robin order.

====== DEC_GET_SEQ_INFO
This command returns the information of the current sequence in the form of
<<vpuapi_h_DecInitialInfo>> structure. HOST can get this information with more
accuracy after VPU_DecIssueSeqInit() or VPU_DecGetOutputInfo() is called.

====== ENABLE_LOGGING
HOST can activate message logging once VPU_DecOpen() or VPU_EncOpen() is called.

====== DISABLE_LOGGING
HOST can deactivate message logging which is off as default.

====== DEC_ENABLE_AVC_MC_INTERPOL
This is option for enable fast MC interpolation. this command is only used for
H.264/AVC decoder.

====== DEC_DISABLE_AVC_MC_INTERPOL
This is option for disable fast MC interpolation. this command is only used for
H.264/AVC decoder.

====== DEC_SET_2ND_FIELD_INFO
This command sets bistream buffer information for a second field after a first
field has been decoded. In case of H.264/AVC, MPEG2, or VC1 decoder, they issue
an INT_BIT_DEC_FIELD interrupt after first field decoding. This command then can
give VPU the address and size of bitstream buffer for a second field. This
commands is used when first field and second field are in separate bistreams -
not together in a bitstream. If HOST gives this command and clears the
INT_BIT_DEC_FIELD interrupt, VPU starts decoding from the given base address
until the size of bitstream buffer.

====== DEC_GET_FIELD_PIC_TYPE
This command gets a field picture type of decoded picture after
INT_BIT_DEC_FIELD interrupt is issued.

====== DEC_ENABLE_REORDER
HOST can enable display buffer reordering when decoding H.264 streams. In H.264
case output decoded picture may be re-ordered if pic_order_cnt_type is 0 or 1.
In that case, decoder must delay output display for re-ordering but some
applications (ex. video telephony) do not want such display delay.

====== DEC_DISABLE_REORDER
HOST can disable output display buffer reorder-ing. Then BIT processor does not
re-order output buffer when pic_order_cnt_type is 0 or 1. If In H.264/AVC case.
pic_order_cnt_type is 2 or the other standard case, this flag is ignored because
output display buffer reordering is not allowed.

====== DEC_GET_FRAMEBUF_INFO
This command gives HOST the information of framebuffer in the form of
DecGetFramebufInfo structure.

====== DEC_RESET_FRAMEBUF_INFO
This command resets the information of framebuffer.
Unlike DEC_FREE_FRAME_BUFFER, it does not release the assigned memory itself.
This command is used for sequence change along with DEC_GET_FRAMEBUF_INFO.

====== ENABLE_REP_CUDATA
This command enables to report CU data.

====== DISABLE_REP_CUDATA
This command disables to report CU data.

====== SET_ADDR_REP_CUDATA
This command sets the address of buffer where CU data is written.

====== SET_SIZE_REP_CUDATA
This command sets the size of buffer where CU data is written.

====== DEC_SET_WTL_FRAME_FORMAT
This command sets FrameBufferFormat for WTL.

====== DEC_SET_AVC_ERROR_CONCEAL_MODE
This command sets error conceal mode for H.264 decoder.
This command must be issued through VPU_DecGiveCommand() before calling
VPU_DecGetInitialInfo() or VPU_DecIssueSeqInit(). In other words, error conceal
mode cannot be applied once a sequence initialized.

@* AVC_ERROR_CONCEAL_MODE_DEFAULT - VPU performs error concealment in default
mode.
@* AVC_ERROR_CONCEAL_MODE_ENABLE_SELECTIVE_CONCEAL_MISSING_REFERENCE -
VPU performs error concealment using another framebuffer if the error comes from
missing reference frame.
@* AVC_ERROR_CONCEAL_MODE_DISABLE_CONCEAL_MISSING_REFERENCE -
VPU does not perform error concealment if the error comes from missing reference
frame.
@* AVC_ERROR_CONCEAL_MODE_DISABLE_CONCEAL_WRONG_FRAME_NUM -
VPU does not perform error concealment if the error comes from wrong frame_num
syntax.

====== DEC_GET_SCALER_INFO
This command returns setting information to downscale an image such as enable,
width, and height.

====== DEC_SET_SCALER_INFO
This command sets information to downscale an image such as enable, width, and
height.

====== DEC_SET_TARGET_TEMPORAL_ID
This command decodes only a frame whose temporal id is equal to or less than the
given target temporal id.

NOTE: It is only for H.265/HEVC decoder.

====== DEC_SET_BWB_CUR_FRAME_IDX
This command specifies the index of linear frame buffer which needs to be
changed to due to change of inter-frame resolution while decoding.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_SET_FBC_CUR_FRAME_IDX
This command specifies the index of FBC frame buffer which needs to be changed
to due to change of inter-frame resolution while decoding.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_SET_INTER_RES_INFO_ON
This command informs inter-frame resolution has been changed while decoding.
After this command issued, VPU reallocates one frame buffer for the change.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_SET_INTER_RES_INFO_OFF
This command releases the flag informing inter-frame resolution change.
It should be issued after reallocation of one frame buffer is completed.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_FREE_FBC_TABLE_BUFFER
This command frees one FBC table to deal with inter-frame resolution change.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_FREE_MV_BUFFER
This command frees one MV buffer to deal with inter-frame resolution change.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_ALLOC_FBC_Y_TABLE_BUFFER
This command allocates one FBC luma table to deal with inter-frame resolution
change.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_ALLOC_FBC_C_TABLE_BUFFER
This command allocates one FBC chroma table to deal with inter-frame resolution
change.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

====== DEC_ALLOC_MV_BUFFER
This command allocates one MV buffer to deal with inter-frame resolution change.

NOTE: It is only for VP9 decoder.

VPU_EncGetInitialInfo().

The distance between a pixel in a row and the corresponding pixel in the next
row is called a stride. The value of stride must be a multiple of 8. The
address of the first pixel in the second row does not necessarily coincide with
the value next to the last pixel in the first row. In other words, a stride can
be greater than the picture width in pixels.

Applications should not set a stride value smaller than the picture width.
So, for Y component, HOST application must allocate at least a space of size
(frame height \* stride), and Cb or Cr component,
(frame height/2 \* stride/2), respectively.
But make sure that in Cb/Cr non-interleave (separate Cb/Cr) map,
a stride for the luminance frame buffer should be multiple of 16 so that a
stride for the luminance frame buffer becomes a multiple of 8.

This command encodes videos into H.264/AVC stream with HOST application-given
profile in header syntax. (CODA9 only)

====== ENC_SET_SEI_NAL_DATA
This command sets variables in HevcSEIDataEnc structure for SEI encoding.

====== SET_ENC_WTL_INFO
This command sets information of frame buffer such as Y/Cb/Cr addr,
cbcrinterleave, nv21, and number of linear framebuffer for WTL-enabled encoder.

====== SET_ADDR_ENC_RC_REPORT_BASE
This command sets the base address of report buffer.
It should be specified when any of these bitInfoReportEnable,
frameDistortionReportEnable, or qpHistogramReportEnable in EncParam is on. In
total 144bytes of data are reported to the report buffer from
w4EncReportBaseAddr in the following order. If a certain ReportEnable flag is
diabled i.e frameDistortionReportEnable, dummy data are written into the
frameDistortion region of the buffer.

--
* bit information

@* Header bits : total slice header bits of the current frame except start code
@* Residual bits : total residual bits of the current frame

header bits are in the beginning 32bits of w4EncReportBaseAddr,
 and header bits are in the following 32bits of the report buffer.

* frame distortion

With this command,
frame distortion data - frame distortion sum, y, cb, and cr for each 8bytes,
totally 32bytes) are reported 8bytes away from w4EncReportBaseAddr
(w4EncReportBaseAddr + 8) when picture encoding is completed.

* QP histogram

With this command,
QP histogram for every subCTU(CU32) taking 16bits are reported 40bytes away from
w4EncReportBaseAddr (w4EncReportBaseAddr + 40) when picture encoding is
completed.
--

====== SET_SIZE_ENC_RC_REPORT
This command sets the size of report buffer.
It should be specified when any of these bitInfoReportEnable,
frameDistortionReportEnable, or qpHistogramReportEnable in EncParam is on.

* @brief
@verbatim
This function starts encoding one frame. Returning from this function does not
mean the completion of encoding one frame, and it is just that encoding one
frame was initiated.

Every call of this function should be matched with VPU_EncGetOutputInfo()
with the same handle. Without calling a pair of these funtions,
HOST application cannot call any other API functions
except for VPU_IsBusy(), VPU_EncGetBitstreamBuffer(), and
VPU_EncUpdateBitstreamBuffer().

Operation was done successfully, which means encoding a new frame was started
successfully.

NOTE: This return value does not mean that encoding a frame was completed
successfully.

*RETCODE_INVALID_HANDLE* ::
This means the given handle for the current API function call, pHandle, was
invalid. This return code might be caused if

* handle is not a handle which has been obtained by VPU_EncOpen().
* handle is a handle of an instance which has been closed already, etc.

*RETCODE_FRAME_NOT_COMPLETE* ::
This means frame decoding or encoding operation was not completed yet, so the
given API function call cannot be performed this time. A frame encoding or
decoding operation should be completed by calling VPU_EncGetOutputInfo() or
VPU_DecGetOutputInfo(). Even though the result of the current frame operation is
not necessary, HOST application should call VPU_EncGetOutputInfo() or
VPU_DecGetOutputInfo() to proceed this function call.

*RETCODE_WRONG_CALL_SEQUENCE* ::
This means the current API function call was invalid considering the allowed
sequences between API functions. In this case, HOST application might call this
function before successfully calling VPU_EncRegisterFrameBuffer(). This function
should be called after successfully calling VPU_EncRegisterFrameBuffer().

*RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM* ::
The given argument parameter, `parameter`, was invalid, which means it has a
null pointer, or given values for some member variables are improper values.

*RETCODE_INVALID_FRAME_BUFFER* ::
This means sourceFrame in input structure EncParam was invalid, which means
sourceFrame was not valid even though picture-skip is disabled.
